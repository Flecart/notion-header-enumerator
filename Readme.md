# Notion header numberer
Mini-project for notion pages organization

## What is this
I wanted to have a notion integration that gives numbers to the headings of my
notes automatically.
I want this to be automatic so i can focus on what it's important, that is studying.

## How this works
It looks at the first number of a heading 1 block type in Notion and then
it gives numbers subsequently based on the last heading 2 or 3.

It gives error if the heading 1 hasn't got a number.
